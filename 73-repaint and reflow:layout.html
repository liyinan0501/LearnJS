      // 1. Parser HTML, and create DOM Tree
      //              same time
      //    Parser CSS, and create Style Rules
      // 2. Attachment of DOM Tree and Style Rules, and create Render Tree
      // 3. Layout/Reflow: according to the Render Tree, layout the page and get nodes information(position, size)
      // 4. Repaint: painting whole page (color, background)
      // 5. Display

      // Layout/Reflow: if there some changes happen in Render Tree like changing the size, contracture, will cause render again, which is called Layout/Reflow
      // Repaint: if there same changes like color, outline, which won't impact on the page structure, that is called Repaint

      // * Sometimes Repaint can not cause the Layout/Reflow, but Layout/Reflow can definitely cause the Repaint
